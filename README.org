* PageNavigator
Basic page navigation abstraction that I've found to be useful when paired with cron for automatic scheduled page scraping.
Began as a script to cheat at [[https://www.travian.com][the browser game Travian]] but which I co-opted to scrape apartment prices from a local site.
Eventually the fluctuating prices made me depressed so I found an apartment on Craigslist instead.
Might use it again sometime to interact with more pages.
Don't actually use the crontab, just gives an idea for how to automate.

* TODO
** Feature parity with original script
*** More idiomatic startup execution
**** Change example to use it
*** (Better) Clicking
*** Typing
*** Scrolling (if needed)
